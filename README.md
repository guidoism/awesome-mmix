## Software

- [mmixware](https://gitlab.lrz.de/mmix/mmixware) - All of the documentation, assembler, simulator, even better pipelined simulator, example programs. If you want to *really* understand MMIX you need to `cweave` these files into pdfs and read them. There's a *lot* of good info there.
- [mmixlib](https://gitlab.lrz.de/mmix/mmixlib) - The MMIX assembler and simulator broken out into a library so it can be used directly by applications
- [mmix-wasm](https://blog.y2kbugger.com/mmix-wasm.html) - Simple online MMIX assembler and simulator using mmixlib compiled to WASM

## Other information

- [Main MMIX website](http://mmix.cs.hm.edu) - Seems kinda out-of-date
